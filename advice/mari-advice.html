			<h4>Enjoy the learning process!</h4>
			<p>When I decided I wanted to learn coding, I did not realize how much there is to learn! It feels like I just got introduced to a new concept and then boom! That new concept branches off to another new concept. 
				There really is sooo much to learn and it can become overwhelming and sometimes frustrating. Also with technology changing rapidly, I thnk it is wise that you prepare yourself to become a life-long learner and enjoy the process along the way to make it worthwhile. </p>
			<h4>Have a problem-solver mindset</h4>
			<p>You'll bound to encounter problems one way or another. Put on a smile. Take a deep breath and do your best to find a solution. That could be just trying to solve it on your own, looking into the world wide web, asking experts and colleagues. Have patience, you can do it! </p>

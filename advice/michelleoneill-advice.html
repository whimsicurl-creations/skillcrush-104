			<h4>Motivation is key!</h4>
			<p>When you start off at Skillcrush, I'd say it would be common to start off with a hiss and a roar. Until a roadblock hits you like a tonne of bricks. You're stuck, feel stupid and wonder why you're doing this in the first place.</p>

			<p>Never fear though. Help is only a mouse-pad click away!</p>

			<h4>Finding what motivates you helps.</h4>
			<p>When you're on the journey of coding and web development, try to remember why you started doing this in the first place.</p>

			<p>Remember how much of a buzz it was when you completed the 10-day bootcamp? You were thirsty for more and could see a brighter work future. Something that actually excites you!</p>

			<p>Some days it would help to have a motivating pod-cast to listen to while you're walking your dog along the beach, or when you first wake up in the morning?</p>

			<h2>You Can Do This!!</h2>
			<p>Take notes, take your time and Google, my dear, is your friend. Don't be afraid to ask for help. But try to figure it out on your own. But if all else fails there is nothing wrong with asking for a little help. Looking back at it after the help you will probably be able to figure out what went wrong and it will further your understanding.</p>
			<p>Practice, practice, practice. And most of all don't forget to take a break. Your brain needs to relax and breathe.</p>

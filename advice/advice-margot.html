			<h4>Be patient with yourself</h4>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<p>When I started teaching myself to code earlier this summer, I wasn't sure how it would go. I have lots of friends who were computer science majors in college, and even back then, learning all the complicated syntax always seemed really daunting. (This, coming from a biochemistry major!)</p>

			<p>Skillcrush is definitely helping- the explanations and practice projects help to solidify what I'm learning, and I love having some work online (<a href="http://www.kieledesign.com/" target="_BLANK">websites</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lindyspice" target="_BLANK">code on github</a>!) that I can show for it.</p>

			<p>Put in the time; think about what you're doing and why. Eventually it will start to stick, and you'll have a new achievement to be proud of. Old dogs <strong>can</strong> learn new tricks!</p>

			<h4>The 20 Minute Rule</h4>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>I picked this one up from an article on <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/7-tips-learn-programming-faster/" target="_BLANK">Coding Dojo</a>: Ask for help when you're stuck, but spend at least 20 minutes trying to figure something out on your own first. Thereâ€™s a good chance that the answer is already in front of you, and if you can push through the discomfort to find the answer yourself, you'll become a better programmer.</p>

			<p>That said, if taking a break and a fresh perspective aren't enough, don't stay stuck- ask for help!</p>

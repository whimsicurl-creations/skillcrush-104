			<h4>You will have many head-scratch moments</h4>

			<p>There will be moments where you are super confused, these will occur early and often. Don't let that dissuade you! You can push through it!</p>

			<p>Often, the moments of greatest confusion lead to the greatest breakthroughs. The fact that you are confused means you are starting to make connections. Those moments will help solidify what you already know, and those knowledge nuggets will become the foundation upon which you will build!</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>

			<p>You won't always know why something works (or doesn't) right away. However, there are these beautiful moments where something clicks, and you'll add a layer of understanding to your knowledge nugget.</p>

			<p>I feel weird about my nugget metaphor, but I'm too far down that path to take it back now...</p>

			<p>Stick with it. You'll build on what you know, little by little, by doing the work.</p>

            <h4>Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes</h4>

			<p>No one wakes up one day knowing how to do everything, let alone do it perfect on the first try. Making mistakes is important for growth, it helps us understand why things work the way they do.</p>

			<h4>Don't Compare Yourself to Others</h4>
			<p>We all have our strenghts and weaknesses. The important thing is to stick with something and not quit because you're not as good as this person or that person. You're just not there yet, but with hard work someday you can be.

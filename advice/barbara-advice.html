			<h4>A Little Inspiration</h4>
			<p>“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means <strong>effort, pain, difficulty…</strong> I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.” ― Theodore Roosevelt </p>
			<p> “We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our <strong>training</strong>.” — Archilochus</p>
			<p>Life is a gift. <strong>Every day you have another chance,</strong> another opportunity to make a difference.</p>
			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you're doing something that you've never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before. How exciting!</p>
			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
			<h4>Mistakes Were Meant to be Made</h4>
			<p>Making mistakes is a critical part of the learning process. The more you troubleshoot, the more you learn new ways to solve problems, and the faster you grow. Don't let them discourage you. Instead, embrace those mistakes and appreciate that you're making them sooner rather than later! </p>

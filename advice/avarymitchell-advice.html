			<h4>Discipline is important!</h4>
			<p>Programming is a challenge and it takes effort, patience and understanding to progress. Confusion and fustration are part of the process and sometimes certain things may seem daunting. The feeling of doubt may also arise because of how uncomfortable you are learning to program for the first time.</p>

			<p>Take your time and learn at your own pace. Allow yourself to be a student who is willing to learn and not cram as much information into your head as possible. Pay attention and experiment so that you have a better understanding of the basic principles of whatever language you may be learning. Keep working despite how you may feel at the moment and always dedicate a set amount of time to learn no matter what.</p>

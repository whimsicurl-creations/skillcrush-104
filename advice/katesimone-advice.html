			<h4>It's all about problem solving!</h4>
			<p>You might run into all kinds of weird problems when you code. From floats that won't float to colors in the wrong spot to divs that aren't closed: there are one million tiny things that can go wrong.</p>

			<p>But that's okay! Because every mistake that you fix is a thing you learned and one step closer to being a great coder.</p>

			<h4>Use the community!</h4>
			<p>Some days when I just didn't get something, heading to the Slack channels made all the difference. I often didn't even need to reach out to ask a question because often someone else had asked it already. AND, even more importantly, seeing other people talk about their challenges and wins made me feel like I wasn't alone.</p>

			<p>Learning something new is hard and having other people to talk to makes all the difference.</p>

			<h4>Just keep swimming!</h4>
			<p>I missed a few days. Womp womp. I was annoyed with myself and then felt like I forgot all the stuff I learned... But then I had a little talk with myself and said: Kate, remember how good it felt when the code worked? Let's do it again.</p>

			<p>Life is really busy and sometimes I just don't have time to work on this thing. But all those tiny steps on the days when I do my classes are adding up to one awesome coder!</p>

			<h4>Fight Your Way Through It</h4>
			<p>Ira Glass said it first, and I'm here to reiterate it. You are a beginner, learning a brand new language, taking in tons of information. It will be tough and confusing at times! The key is to push through. Stay focused on why you're making this leap of faith.</p>

			<p>I've found myself overwhelmed more often than not. And then I think about all the reasons why I'm here, learning to code, and it puts me right back on track. Let's be honest, I know my work is not the greatest, but I keep working at it because one day I know it will be.</p>

			<h4>Do a lot of work &amp; your work will be as good as your ambitions</h4>
			<p>It's easy to say practice makes perfect, but it holds true! Or at least, practice makes better, and better, and better...</p>

			<p>Anyone can learn to code. But the recipe for success with coding is to put that knowledge into practice. Try to code, try again and try some more. Look for all opportunities to practuce your craft and to make it better. Every minute you spend coding is a minute closer to being more adept.</p>

			<p>So keep clacking away at those keys, keep reading that new blog post, keep refreshing your knowledge base.</p>

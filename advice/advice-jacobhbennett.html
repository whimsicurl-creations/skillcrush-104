			<h4>Keep on pushing!</h4>
			<p>I began this journey when my wife was already a few months pregnant. Knowing I needed to expand my options to help provide for my family I started taking these classes. Then the kid was born. Let me tell you, its tough to find time to get class work done, but I'm continuing to push through.</p>

			<p>If I can find the time around a full time job and a 6-week old kid, so can you. Never give up, never surrender!</p>

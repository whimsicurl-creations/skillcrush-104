			<h2>Advice from a fellow newbie.... </h2>

			<div class="third-width">
				<h4>It's OK to feel overwhelmed!</h4>
				<p>You may be thinking, "What the heck did I just get myself into?!"</p>
				<p>We have all been there.  We are all STILL there somedays (most days)! But this is completely normal and to be expected.</p>
				<p>Learning to code is introducing an entirely new language--an entirely new way of thinking--to our brains.  It's gonna be a bumpy ride!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="third-width">
				<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
				<p>Because learning to code may be the single most overwhelming thing you have done in a long while, it is expected that the learning process will come with a lot of confusion, and THAT'S OK! </p>
				<p>Confusion is a sign that you are pushing through in the right direction because you are attempting to problem solve.  Keep pushing through because it's worth the process to reach the clarity on the other side.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="third-width">
				<h4>It just won't make sense... for awhile.</h4>
				<p>A lot of coding that you will encounter will do things that you know it needs to do, but it will not be clear at all HOW it is doing that thing.</p>
				<p>A crucial part of the process is seeing this code, exposing yourself to it consistently, because one day it WILL make sense, and the only way you will get there is by the familiarity that comes from that exposure even when it's not making sense.</p>

				<h2>No matter what... DON'T GIVE UP</h2>

				<div id="last-section">

					<p>The best advice I heard when starting out was, "Don't Give Up."</p>

					<p>Originally, I thought, "Well DUH!" But when I dove in I realized just how crucial this advice is. </p>

					<p>You WILL feel overwhelmed, confused, unsure of how you got the results you needed.<br>You WILL feel the sting of a complicated journey to a relatively easy solution.<br>You WILL feel stuck.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="last">
					<h3>...just DON'T. GIVE. UP.</h3>

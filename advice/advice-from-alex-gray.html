			<h2>How I started out 6 months ago</h2>
			<p>I started my coding journey on Udemy and W3Schools. This was great, but for me I soon found some of the courses I had started on Udemy had their downsides. I was a complete beginner and they expected me to have some prior knowledge, or I felt I needed a more in depth breakdown of what was going on.</p>

			<h2>A great way to learn something new outside of Skillcrush!</h2>
			<p>When I discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> I felt like I had turned a corner. They have recently updated the entire site and include so many exercises across a vast curicculum! They really break things down into manageable steps with end of section projects bringing everything together with a certificate!</p>

			<h2>When you need answers!</h2>
				<p>I use the following to get answers when I get stuck!</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a></p>

				<h2>Supportive Communities</h2>
					<p>Skillcrush obviously!</p>
					<p>If you have a twitter account, #100DaysOfCode is a great one to join in on and keep each other accountable on your coding journey!</p>

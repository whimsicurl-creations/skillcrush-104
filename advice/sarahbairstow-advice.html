		<h1>Hi, my name's Sarah, and I have some advice for you.</h1>
	</header>

	<section>
		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Thing One: You are where you are.</h4>
			<p>There are always going to be people out there who know more than you do. That's OK, and it's actually good. You aren't expected to be an expert from the beginning. Instead of comparing yourself to others and focusing on how little you know, see what you can learn from those who are further down the road.</p>

			<p>Every day you'll learn something new. It's important to look back and celebrate, even if it feels a little indulgent. Celebrating is like fuel: you'll be motivated to keep going.</p>

			<h4>Thing Two: Make learning a priority.</h4>
			<p>Most of us have jobs and many other obligations that keep us from doing all we wish to do. Finding the time to learn new things isn't easy, especially when the final destination appears to be so far off. It can seem unreachable.</p>

			<p>Sometimes it can be hard to set time aside for something we actually enjoy. Be aware of that, and push onwards, because that's bullshit.</p>

			<p>Bear in mind that a lot of the time-sucking activities we take part in are there to numb us to whatever lack of satisfaction we might be experiencing. Choose to go against the current. Learn something that will bring the satisfaction you crave.</p>

			<h4>Thing Three: Swear like a sailor, but then laugh at yourself.</h4>
			<p>Everything that's new and unknown can cause fear and frustration. There will be times when you won't get it, or when it doesn't work, no matter what you try.<p>

			<p>Go ahead and vent your frustration. Just maybe try not to break anything expensive?</p>

			<p>You're learning a new language, and the first time you did that you were a babbling baby. Look stupid; laugh at yourself and enjoy it. You'll get there eventually.</p>

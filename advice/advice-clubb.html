		<div>Becoming a developer is not difficult. Being a good developer takes hard work and discipline. If you are just starting, it is a good idea to consider the following tips.
		</div>
		<div class="third-width-clubb">
			<h4 class="advice-titles-clubb">Have a goal</h4>
			<p>What is your end goal? Write it down! Once you have it on paper, it seems more real and more achievable. You can also go into sub-goals, setting the goals you need to meet in order to meet the big one.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="third-width-clubb">
			<h4 class="advice-titles-clubb">Code and code some more</h4>
			<p>You can read 100 books and watch 100 videos. But you will end up learning mostly from coding. You will break your code and fix it several times and even though it is frustrating, you are learning. Remember that!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="third-width-clubb">
			<h4 class="advice-titles-clubb">The web is your friend</h4>
			<p>Sometimes you want to solve a problem without asking for help and that's OK as long as it doesns't take hours of your time. You can always though, get help online. You can be sure that the problem you are trying to solve has been someone else's problem too. So, don't break your brain trying to find a solution, Google it.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="full-width-clubb">
		<div class="half-width-clubb">
			<h4 class="advice-titles-clubb">Borrow code</h4>
			<p>Well, it is not like you are going to give the code back, so just use people's codes. Why not use something that someone else has created? Even thought it might sound bad for some of you, you have to remember that time is money. The faster and accurately create a course, the happier everyone will be.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="half-width-clubb">	
			<h4 class="advice-titles-clubb">Have a portfolio</h4>
			<p>You can code all day and be good at it, but if you don't have a killer portfolio, it will be hard to get a job. Employers want to see what you have build in order to invest in you.</p>

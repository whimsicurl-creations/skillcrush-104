			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>I new this journey would be tough, but I didn't think it would be this hard. The best thing to do is take your time. It will be confusing.  It will take time to sort through all this new material and be able to understand it.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Not understanding at first, plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. Take your time.  If you get stuck or frustrated, stop.  Take a time-out.  Go do something else for a while and come back to it later.  Sometimes when you are not focussing on the problem, solutions can just come to you.</p>

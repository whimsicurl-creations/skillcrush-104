			<h4>Coding takes practice, practice, practice</h4>
			<p>Coding is very much like learning to read music and play a particular instrument.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, you learn the conventions of a language, some basic commands, proper language syntax, and the meta structure of the language. Of course this goes over your head and you wonder why someone is telling you all this. You just want to make a web page!</li>

				<li>Next, you try a few simple projects. You see the results and you become excited about how you will rule the world with your coding. It is starting to make sense and it is EASY!</li>

				<li>Then you run into a project that requires you figure out something you don't know how to do. You are stumped and frustrated. This is where the boring stuff in bullet &#35;1 comes in handy. If you have been paying attention and practicing and learning the boring stuff while at the same time having fun with the actual coding, you will have a big headstart on solving your problem. You will be familiar with reading coding documentation, understanding how commands are described generically, and have an idea of where you could/should look for your solution or ideas for a solution.</li>

				<li>This is why the boring stuff and practicing your coding are so important. The more familiar and comfortable you get with a language, i.e., the commands and the way people think in that language, the easier it is to learn more commands, find your coding errors, and hone your skills for that language. Learning the big picture for a language pays off in more clean, easy to maintain coding, greater debugging skills, and more efficient, faster coding.</li>

				<li>The whopping bonus to all this work is when you learn your next language, it will be that much easier to become proficient.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Allow yourself to be confused <br>and <br>curious at the same time</h4>
			<p>The confusion part just happens as a response to learning. Let yourself sit with the uncomfortableness. By allowing the feeling to just be there instead of adding anxiety or worry to the mix because you are feeling uncomfortable, you learn that confusion (the uncomfortable feeling it produces) need not get in your way of learning or figuring things out.</p>

			<p>When you notice the uncomfortable feeling of confusion, say to yourself, "Oh, goody! I'm about to learn something important." Then get curious about your confusion, what you are reading, what you are hearing, what you are attempting to do. Slow down your thinking process, take apart the new learning or the problem (down to understandable components). Reconstruct things so you understand them from the bottom, up. This process will help you figure out what you really don't know or understand and help you know where to look for explanations.</p>

			<p>Your ability to be in a place of "not knowing" while turning on your curiosity, will pay off in your ability to more quickly learn and solve problems.</p>

			<p>You will come to savor this place as a place of power and as one of the fun parts of coding. It will be your secret weapon in becoming an awesome coder.</p>

			<p>P.S. Learn the CSS box model and the CSS page layout techniques!! These fundamentals will make the rest of your coding life a breeze.</p>

			<h4>Learn to love not knowing shit!</h4>
			<p>You are learning! You can't and you won't know everything. You are a beginner; allow yourself to be a beginner.</p>

			<p>Learning is something that you will never stop doing.  Just because you graduated or you are done with school, there will continute to be things you don't know throughout your whole life.  Learn to love that!  How boring would life be if you knew EVERYTHING?</p>

			<h4>Invest in yourself! You hold the outcome in your hands</h4>
			<p>What is a better invest in this life than yourself? NOTHING.  You can control the outcome of your success based upon the amount of time and effort that you put into yourself, for yourself.</p>

			<p>Take a chance on yourself, believe in yourself, and prove yourself wrong!</p>

			<p>You can do hard things! You ARE doing hard things. And you are succeeding.</p>

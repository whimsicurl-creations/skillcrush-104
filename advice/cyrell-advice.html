			<h4>Does Not Matter How Much You Do, Just Do it Everyday.</h4>
			<p>If there is one thing I have learned from my journey into coding so far, it is that you need to be consistent with it, especially if you want to master it!</p>
			<p>They're are many aspects of learning to code that are very unfamiliar, especially for somebody who has no tech-based backround.</p>
			<p>There is so much information that needs to be retained and the best way to do it is to practice what you have learned on a daily basis.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,<br> you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. <br>The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

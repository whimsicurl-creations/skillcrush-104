			<h4>Be Patient.</h4>
			<p><span>W</span>hen first starting something new you always have to be patient and understand that those skills you're trying to learn don't come overnight. It takes patience and time and a whole lot of practice before you become a seasoned veteran and that holds true in all walks of life. Sometimes you just have to put your pride to the side and know that you will make mistakes and there will be roadblocks but that's just a part of becoming the best version of yourself and once you get past those struggles you will have every reason to be proud of what you've accomplished.</p>

			<p><span>E</span>ven as a seasoned professional you will make mistakes here and there but just know that it happens to the best of us and you're not alone, especially in the tech community.</p>

			<h4>Stay positive.</h4>
			<p><span>T</span>here will be times when you just don't understand something but don't get down on yourself, coding can be a pain in the ass sometimes when it's not going the way you invisioned it but keep your head up. There is always a solution to every problem, it just takes time and thought to find it.</p>

			<p><span>A</span>lways know that if something doesn't look right, don't sulk and feel hopeless because it could turn out to just be one small thing that lead to an issue that looks big but it isn't, code is funny that way. But you can easily fix it with a quick glance over what you've coded and see where your mistake is, lots of the time you might've just missed a letter of character in your tags.</p>

			<p><span>W</span>e all started at the bottom and worked our way up the tech latter and just know it feels amazing once you get the the top!</p>

				<h4>Review, review, review!</h4>
				<p>Even though you have seen all the directions on what to do, don't think it's cheating to look back at previous lessons. The sneaky, stinky syntax is not intuitive, so don't even pretend to remember it. Cheat sheets are your friend.</p>

				<p>For particularly sticky code syntax, make your own cheat sheet (image as a background was the first I made and I have referred to it more than once already.)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="box-2">
				<h4>Try until you are REALLY stuck, and then ask for help.</h4>
				<p>I think it is helpful to get as close to the answer as possible by reviewing and and using cheat sheets (see above), but sometimes you just need a wind-assist. The student community and the skillcrush staff are both quite friendly and helpful.</p>

				<p>Code validators are also helpful, particularly with those sneaky syntax errors, dangling divs, missing semi-colons, etc.</p>

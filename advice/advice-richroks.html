			<h1>Hi my name is Rich and I have some advice for you!</h1>
			<h4>Find Your Motivation</h4>
			<p>When you first decide that you want to begin a web developer, go in knowing that it's going to take dedication. It's not the hardest thing in the world to pick up but casual learners will struggle a bit. Coding takes patience, memory, and attention to detail. My first bit of advice would be to find your motivation.</p>

			<p>Why are you doing this? Why are you getting into coding in the first place? Is it a hobby? A necessity? Are you doing it for your family, your children, or simply because you want more out of life? I recommend finding your motivation and then obsess over it. Let it drive you to greatness! </p>

			<h4>Practice is Your "Fast Track" to Success</h4>
			<p>There are a ton of resources out there that can get you to where you want to be. Some paid, some free, but plenty of resources to help you learn. Being on a low budget doesn't mean much when it comes to learning code. It may cause more work on your part to FIND the resources but you don't need to spend a lot of money to learn what you need. The real secret is... practice.</p>

			<p>Learn something cool in a course? Go try it out. Stumble across a great piece of code? Use it and tweak it where you can. Learn how it works and continue to add it to your mental library! Like anything else in life, what you don't use, you lose. Learning is always great but actually putting it into practice is better!</p>

			<h4>Stay Hungry</h4>
			<p>Never get to the point where you think you've arrived. You always can do better, be better, and learn more. Not only are they many languages out there that can make you a very diverse (and useful) developer but coding language is always evolving. So don't fall into the trap of only knowing old code and the old ways.</p>

			<p>Aditionally, your clients and boss will notice. I've learned that the people around me can see my hunger for knowledge and they begin to respect it and you. I can't tell you the number of times that my boss saw my drive to learn and not only offered to pay for my advanced courses but also trusted me with a promotion within the company/department. Personal growth is admired and showing others that you desire to be useful makes you stand out from the crowd.</p>

			<h4>You <span>can't fail</span> unless you <span>give up</span>!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you might think that it will be a nice, linear journey from point A of knowlegelessness to point B of badass mastery.</p>

			<p>With Skillcrush's help, things will be presented in a much more organized and easy-to-understand way than they would be had you tried to go it on your own with the plethora of free resources out there (trust me, I tried).</p>

			<p>So what you really want to do is succeed with this new thing you're doing, but when success seems far away and possibly too hard-earned, you may be tempted to throw in the towel and say, "Well, this coding thing just wasn't for me."</p>

			<p>If you do that, you will surely have failed.</p>

			<p>But if you hang in there, and don't give up, and push through, understanding will come. Understanding, familiarity... and eventually, you will be able to use these technologies to build yourself a better life.</p>

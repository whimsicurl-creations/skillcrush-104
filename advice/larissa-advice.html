			<h4>Just start doing something!</h4>
			<p>Start somewhere. Don't be intimidated. Just do it.</p>
			<p>Just tell yourself you'll try it for 5 minutes and see where it leads.</p>

			<h4>Sometimes you'll fail...hard. But that's all part of learning.</h4>
			<p>Mistakes happen. What matters is that you keep going.</p>

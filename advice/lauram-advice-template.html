			<h4>You're going to get it!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>It's a lot like learning a new language.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new language, you make mistakes because it is something new and foreign. Relax, this is normal. Give youself credit for the work you are doing and look at how much you are improving every day.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Taking breaks and stepping away for a few minutes will help to clear your head. Don't try to force solutions, and don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>

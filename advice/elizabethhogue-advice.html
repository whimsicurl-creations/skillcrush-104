			<h4>Make Time</h4>
			<p>You will only learn if you take the time to do so. It's easy to put learning on the back burner, but if you take the time, you can change your life.</p>

			<h4>Remember that Everyone was once a Beginner</h4>
			<p>Sometimes I get bogged down in the "newness" of my technology journey. I have to remember to remind myself that no one started out where they currently are. Everyone, at one time, only knew as much as I do now.</p>

			<h4>Look and Learn</h4>	
			<p>I love looking at souce code for websites and website design. Now that I have knowledge of code, I love seeing how a website is put together, especially ones I find particularly beautiful. Don't forget that you can view the souce code of any webiste. It may help you learn.</p>
